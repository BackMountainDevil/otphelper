# Copy SMS Code: Privacy Policy

"Copy SMS Code" app only stores settings that are required to run the app, locally, on your device. The app does not use internet access permission and so your data is not uploaded anywhere. The developers of "Copy SMS Code" do not have access to it. Your data is not shared with any third parties. "Copy SMS Code" does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics or Facebook SDK.

**NOTE**: If you have activated “Backup & Reset” in your phone settings (Settings / Backup & Reset / Back up my data), you should be aware that Android itself (not "Copy SMS Code") will periodically save a copy of your phone’s data in Google’s servers. This allows Android to recover your data in case your device gets damaged, or you purchase a new device. The developers of "Copy SMS Code" do not have access to this data.
